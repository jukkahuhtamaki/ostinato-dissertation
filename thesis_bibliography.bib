abstract = {Rooted in neoclassical economics, network effects research has revolved around size, arguing that the more users a network has, the more valuable that network will be to each user. I argue that a network's structure (feasibility of transactions, centrality of members, structural holes, network ties, the number of roles each member plays) and its conduct (opportunistic behavior, reputation signaling, perceptions of trust) also have significant impacts on a network's value to users and to network providers. Network research that neglects structure and conduct and focuses only on size can lead to wrong strategies or a misleading research agenda. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Traditional approaches have primarily utilized alliance data of relatively established firms; however, these approaches ignore the vast number of relevant ecosystem activities that occur at the personal, entrepreneurial, and university level.

abstract = {Scholars of industrial clusters and networks have recently called for more research on network’s chance over time. This paper contributes a further step along that path. It uses micro-level data based on the execution of a pair of identical studies in the main wine cluster in Chile in 2002 and 2006. Through the collection of social network data, it explores the role of a set of mechanisms of social interaction to explain the change in the cluster knowledge network. Two particular findings are important. First, in line with other network studies, we find that well-known micro-level mechanisms of social interaction, such as homophily, reciprocity and transitivity, do influence the formation of new knowledge linkages among cluster firms. Second, however, we find that these mechanisms seem not to work when firms have weak knowledge bases, as firms with a level of knowledge bases below a minimum threshold are consistently cast out of the cluster knowledge network, in some cases even exit the cluster. A more general finding of this study is the coexistence of a significant instability at the micro-level with meso-level stability in the structural properties of the intra-cluster knowledge network, in line with the idea of retention put forward by evolutionary economists to explain the path dependent nature of economic systems. Possible reasons for this and implications for further research are discussed.},

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

abstract = {Along social media and Web 2.0, the amount of data sources potentially available for social network visualisation has snowballed. Recent development on information visualisation technologies contribute to the availability of tools enabling visualisation of social media data. Yet, applying the tools in different usage contexts is often difficult. The data formats vary and many of the tools are platform-specific. Potential tools each have their strengths but often a single tool is not sufficient for covering all the aspects of analysis. In this paper, we describe the means of applying component-based information visualisation to streamline social network visualisation. Further, through our approach, we seek to narrow the gap between everyday knowledge work and visual social network analysis of the data that knowledge workers process. We acknowledge the need of programming skills in introducing the visualisations to different usage contexts but yet we see that teams of analysts can apply the approach when conducting network analysis in varying contexts. The main contributions of this article are the following: a description and an analysis of a streamlined social network visual analysis process and a brief review of the related applications and tools, based on the idea of conceptual integration of visual social network analysis and augmented browsing.},

Consequently, new requirements are posed to innovation measurement. Demola is an open innovation platform that takes real-life problems from companies and other organizations and puts together and facilitates projects where students from different universities come together to solve the problems. This paper describes a set of network visualizations and animations that were developed in co-creation with the Demola operators to make visible the activity that Demola has initiated. Moreover, the development process used to design the visualizations and the technical process that was applied are described and discussed. We claim that static network visualizations and animations of an open innovation platform development are useful in presenting, describing, marketing and selling the platform for existing and new stakeholders. Our experience shows that in order to develop visualizations and animations that meet the requirements set by the different stakeholders, an iterative and incremental development process is needed. Moreover, we claim that taking a data-driven approach to visualization development is a key enabler in supporting the development.},

The interactive visual analytics approach transforms data into views that allow the visual exploration of the structures and processes of networks represented by data, therefore increasing the transparency of editorial processes on social media as well as networked structures in innovation ecosystems and other phenomena. Although existing tools have opened many new exploratory opportunities, new tools in development promise investigators even greater freedom to interact with the data, refine and analyze the data, and explore alternative explanations for networked processes. This chapter presents the Ostinato Model – an iterative, user-centric, process-automated model for data-driven visual network analytics. The Ostinato Model simultaneously supports the automation of the process and enables interactive and transparent exploration. The model has two phases, Data Collection and Refinement and Network Creation and Analysis. The Data Collection and Refinement phase is further divided into Entity Index Creation, Web/API Crawling, Scraping, and Data Aggregation. The Network Construction and Analysis phase is composed of Filtering in Entities, Node and Edge Creation, Metrics Calculation, Node and Edge Filtering, Entity Index Refinement, Layout Processing and Visual Properties Configuration. A cycle of exploration and automation characterizes the model and is embedded in each phase.},

abstract = {Winner: Book of the Year, Gold Medal in Business \& Economics,ForeWord ReviewsWinner: Small Business Book AwardsWinner: Independent Publisher Book Awards, Finance/Investment/Economics (Bronze) What makes places like Silicon Valley tick? Can we replicate that magic in other places? How do you foster innovation in your own networks?Discover the answers in this groundbreaking book from two of the world's leading experts at the intersection of venture capital and global development. Victor W. Hwang and Greg Horowitt propose a radical new theory to explain the nature of innovation ecosystems: human networks that generate extraordinary creativity and output. They argue that free market thinking fails to consider the impact of human nature on the innovation process. This ambitious work challenges the basic assumptions that economists have held for over a century.The authors argue that such ecosystems - what they call Rainforests - can only thrive when certain cultural behaviors unlock human potential. People in Rainforests belong to "tribes of trust" and follow a secret unwritten code: the Rules of the Rainforest. The theory of the Rainforest is influenced by several breakthrough ideas in academia, including insights on sociobiology from Harvard, economic transactions from the University of Chicago, design theory from Stanford, andthe latestresearch in neuroscience and social network theory, among others. With an unorthodox and entertaining narrative, the book reveals the mysterious mechanisms of Rainforests. Furthermore, the authors provide practical tools for readers to design, build, and sustain new innovation ecosystems. The Rainforest will transform the way you think about technology, business, and leadership.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, organizations across public and private sectors have made a strategic decision to turn big data into competitive advantage. The challenge of extracting value from big data is similar in many ways to the age-old problem of distilling business intelligence from transactional data. At the heart of this challenge is the process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it to fit your analytical needs, and load it into a data warehouse for subsequent analysis, a process known as “Extract, Transform \& Load” (ETL). The nature of big data requires that the infrastructure for this process can scale cost-effectively. Apache Hadoop* has emerged as the de facto standard for managing big data. This whitepaper examines some of the platform hardware and software considerations in using Hadoop for ETL.},

This process of 'data wrangling' often constitutes the most tedious and time-consuming aspect of analysis. Though data cleaning and integration are longstanding issues in the database community, relatively little research has explored how interactive visualization can advance the state of the art. In this article, we review the challenges and opportunities associated with addressing data quality issues. We argue that analysts might more effectively wrangle data through new interactive systems that integrate data verification, transformation, and visualization. We identify a number of outstanding research questions, including how appropriate visual encodings can facilitate apprehension of missing data, discrepant values, and uncertainty; how interactive visualizations might facilitate data transform specification; and how recorded provenance and social interaction might enable wider reuse, verification, and modification of data transformations.},

abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

Typically, researchers see such organizational advantage as accruing from the particular capabilities organizations have for creating and sharing knowledge. In this article we seek to contribute to this body of work by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the creation of new intellectual capital; (2) organizations, as institutional settings, are conducive to the development of high levels of social capital; and (3) it is because of their more dense social capital that firms, within certain limits, have an advantage over markets in creating and sharing intellectual capital. We present a model that incorporates this overall argument in the form of a series of hypothesized relationships between different dimensions of social capital and the main mechanisms and processes necessary for the creation of intellectual capital.},

In particular, we analyze shifts in the network orchestrator’s actions and the network’s structure and composition. We find that an orchestrator builds the capacity to assemble a network over time through the accumulation of resources and specialized expertise. However, as the network develops, an orchestrator faces an evolving set of dilemmas arising from the need to demonstrate value for various members and audiences. To resolve these dilemmas, orchestrators may shift their actions, moving from initially encouraging serendipitous encounters between network members (“blind dates”) to increasingly selecting members and more closely influencing their interactions (“arranging marriages”). We discuss implications of our findings for a processual understanding of orchestrated network assembly and growth.},

abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

There are, however, firm–specific differences in the tendency to form such relationships. In order to address the issue, this study explores why certain firms in the global ICT sector are better able and more likely to collaborate with their competitors than others. We approach the issue from the structural embeddedness perspective, examining firm centrality in its competitive and alliance networks. The findings indicate that firms with a central position in competitor networks are relatively more likely to engage in coopetition than those not so centrally placed. On the other hand, the findings show that firms holding a central position in their alliance networks collaborate relatively more with complementary partners than with their competitors.},

abstract = {Alumni connections are important resources that contribute to university evaluation. Even though alumni connections represent networks, they have been mostly evaluated as tabular data (e.g. by providing average salary, employment rate, etc.). This ironically disregards all qualities of a network, from which an alumni network gets its name. It is desirable to evaluate an alumni network as a network, because networks have the potential to provide very insightful information. Evaluation of alumni networks as a network has not been feasible in the past due to data fragmentation (neither universities nor companies willing to share meaningfully significant data in its entirety). Recently the feasibility of such analysis has changed, due to new trends towards democratization of information, accelerated by the Web 2.0 user-generated content phenomenon and crowd-sourcing mentality. Utilizing web-crawlers, we actively harvested data and assembled a dataset on alumni in leadership positions in technology-based industries. Moreover, we included a high proportion of startup companies, which allowed us to evaluate alumni networks with respect to entrepreneurial as well as technology involvement. We show that by analyzing alumni connections as networks, it is possible to uncover new patterns, as well as provide a new way of examining the old.},

In innovation ecosystems, co- creation networks are implemented through business financing and interpersonal linkages. Network analysis is used to visualize these relationships. Through the lens of relationship-based synergy and using examples from UK and France, the network dynamics of two innovation ecosystems are described. An action framework that leverages networks for shared vision is presented as an approach to network orchestration for transformation.

Network metrics are interpreted as relationship indicators; and network visualizations reveal existing relationships and distinct patterns that structure the business ecosystems in each geographic area at the enterprise, growth and startup levels. We illustrate that relationship indicators and their visualization can be valuable resources for quantitatively and qualitatively understanding and analyzing the complexities of engagement, agility, structural cohesion, vitality, embeddedness, and linking factors in innovation ecosystems. Furthermore, these indicators highlight opportunities for the development of shared vision through interventions and network orchestration.},

In particular websites categorized as social media provide rich and heterogeneous data about various entities such as people, corporations, brands as well as their properties and relationships. An analyst who seeks to leverage this diverse data is faced with the challenge of integrating and making sense of a set of heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we provide an introduction and a problem statement for heterogeneous web data analytics. To further highlight and discuss practical challenges, we introduce a case study of Finnish growth companies in social media. Instead of a purely data-driven approach, the presented approach is rooted in the idea that an analyst can actively participate in the data collection and integration process, while the process can still retain repeatability and transparency. The key contribution of this paper is the statement of the challenges related to heterogeneous web data analytics.},

abstract = {In a "tipping" model, each node in a social network, representing an individual, adopts a property or behavior if a certain number of his incoming neighbors currently exhibit the same. In viral marketing, a key problem is to select an initial "seed" set from the network such that the entire network adopts any behavior given to the seed. Here we introduce a method for quickly finding seed sets that scales to very large networks. Our approach finds a set of nodes that guarantees spreading to the entire network under the tipping model. After experimentally evaluating 31 real-world networks, we found that our approach often finds seed sets that are several orders of magnitude smaller than the population size and outperform nodal centrality measures in most cases. In addition, our approach scales well - on a Friendster social network consisting of 5.6 million nodes and 28 million edges we found a seed set in under 3.6 hours. Our experiments also indicate that our algorithm provides small seed sets even if high-degree nodes are removed. Lastly, we find that highly clustered local neighborhoods, together with dense network-wide community structures, suppress a trend's ability to spread under the tipping model.},

When the term "big data" first came on the scene, bestselling author Tom Davenport ("Competing on Analytics," "Analytics at Work") thought it was just another example of technology hype. But his research in the years that followed changed his mind. Now, in clear, conversational language, Davenport explains what big data means--and why everyone in business needs to know about it. "Big Data at Work" covers all the bases: what big data means from a technical, consumer, and management perspective; what its opportunities and costs are; where it can have real business impact; and which aspects of this hot topic have been oversold. This book will help you understand: (1) Why big data is important to you and your organization, (2) What technology you need to manage it, (3) How big data could change your job, your company, and your industry, (4) How to hire, rent, or develop the kinds of people who make big data work, (5) The key success factors in implementing any big data project, and (6) How big data is leading to a new approach to managing analytics. With dozens of company examples, including UPS, GE, Amazon, United Healthcare, Citigroup, and many others, this book will help you seize all opportunities--from improving decisions, products, and services to strengthening customer relationships. It will show you how to put big data to work in your own organization so that you too can harness the power of this ever-evolving new resource.},

@article{Weng2013,
abstract = {How does network structure affect diffusion? Recent studies suggest that the answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it is. We present a practical method to translate data about community structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in computational social science, social media analytics, and marketing applications.},
